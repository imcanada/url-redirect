# url-redirect
Redirect to webpages using https://yourdomain.com/go.html?url={your url here}

# Instructions:
1. Donwnload the "sample.htaccess" file and the "go.html" file.
2. Customize the "go.html" file to match your layout for your site (Note: Do not remove the content in the script tags, that's what makes the whole thing run)
3. Change the "sample.htaccess" file to match the filename of your "go.html" file (RewriteRule ^test[^/]$ test.html <-- edit the filename and extension)
4. Upload your files to your website like mine (imcanada.eu / imcanada.cf).
5. Finally rename the "sample.htaccess" file to just ".htaccess" (unless you already have one of course)
